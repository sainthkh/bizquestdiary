# What's this?

In RPG games, you get quests while playing games. To clear the game, you should clear quest by quest. 

I'm not a business master. I started my business at 2014, but I am far from being the master. I've made tons of mistakes and still I am having hard time making ends meet. 

For almost 2 years, I've thought that business is a bit like clearing quests in games. 

* You should visit here and there to gather some information.
* You should fight some monsters(or monstrously hard problems) to go on. 
* You will feel great when you clear the quest(task, job).

In many games, when you clear quests, logs are left. Sadly, it's not the case for business. That's why I've created this site. 

To log my adventures.
