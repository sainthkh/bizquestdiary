# Finding my Passion: My Mother Tongue, Korean Language

In the late September, 2014, I was discharged from my military service. Before joining the army, starting my new own business was my dream. I felt it was time to start it and I did. I bought the domain name, wiseinit.com, and started it. 

At first, I didn't have a topic. I was just wondering here and there. The first topic I took was drawing because I wanted to draw something well. But after a few weeks, I failed. It's because I had not much to write about drawing. For about 2 months, I came from this topic to that topic. I've read a book and other. The time was just going on. 

After a few months, I decided to start teaching Korean, my mother tongue. Part of it was because of the book summary I read in the army. The title was "Selling Korean(한국어를 팝니다)". It was written by the No.1 in the industry, [Talk to me in Korean](http://talktomeinkorean.com). I thought that I could do that, too and started it. 

# Finding Way to Monetize

After a few months, I realized that I should earn money from Korean. So, I've read a few books about Kindle publishing. I've aggregated my blog posts and published it as a book. But epic fail. Until today, I've published 3 books and sold less than 100 copies. 

My savings were constantly decreasing.


# To Learn How to Learn a New Language.

In March, last year(2016), I bought a course about Japanese. It's because I realized that I forgot how to learn a new language. I learned English when I was in elemetary school. It was almost 15 years ago. I had to overcome many hardships to learn English. Still, I am learning how to speak and write English correctly, but the problems I have now are not for beginners. So, to understand the minds of beginners, I had to learn a new language and I decided to start Japanese. 

The price of the course was about $500. It's not a small money. So, I hesitated. However, I made up my mind.

"I can pay them in 5 month payments. Then, it's $100/month. Am I that incapable of making money?"

I thought not. I could earn money with Korean translation. So, I started learning Japanese. 


# Hello, 10KSubs.

I've bought <i>Will it Fly</i> by Pat Flynn on that February after its publication. I"ve read about VideoFriut there. I've subscribed the email list. After a few weeks, I've got an email about the course, "10ksubs". I thought the same thing when I bought the Japanese course. And bought it. And started to follow the course. 

I decided to start a business with Japanese. I thought back then, I can grow by building my authority. I went on and on, but stopped at one point, giveaway. At that point, I felt that I don't have enough money to buy and give away. So, it felt overwhelmed and stopped all 10ksubs and Japanese thing. 


# To Pay the Bills and Move on

I had to translate on and on to pay my bills. Sadly, that job didn't pay well. All I could do was $10/h and if I work more than 2-3 hours a day, I burnt out. The articles I had to translate was not so easy. 

At that time, I started to learn and review web programming. As my major in college was computer science and engineering and I like coding, so I started learning HTML, JavaScript from Codecademy. 

When I used the system of Codecademy, it made me think "how about making Korean language version of Codecademy?"

I wanted to make it, but I couldn't start because the translation job took all of my time and energy. It made me too tired and I had no energy left to think and make some plans about it. 


# Accident and Started Building Membership Site Program

A few months later, I've met a problem. In the translation job, I got bonuses when I translate well. At one point, I got lower grade for one of my article and I read the changes and found out that the proofreaders made mistakes and edited the article strangely. So, I wrote an email about that. Finally, it was fixed, but the damage was done. I couldn't get the bonuses. 

After that accident, I thought, "is this translation thing what I want? Will I be happy if I do this on and on?" 

My answer was "No."

Then, I asked myself what I really want to do. I want to create the learning system for Korean Learners. I want to create videos and quizzes to help them master the language. 

So, it became clear. Even if I get some debts because I don't do this job, I just don't want to get back to that translation job. I liked the articles. I liked the people. I liked the proofreaders although they made a mistake. But that was not the job I wanted. 

So, I decided not to look back. I decided to start my adventure. 


# The completion of the First Version

It took me almost 1.5 months to MVP(Most Viable Product) or MVS(Most Viable System). Design isn't that good. Admin UI is a bit quirky, but the users can use it now. It has less than 5% of the features of the perfect version in my mind. Still, users can use it and I can sell subscription with it. So, I opened it. 


# Start from Zero. And Coming Back to 10ksubs. 

Now, it's time to gather users. And I will sell subscriptions to them. I've bought some courses in Udemy for Business. But I decided to start with my very first course, 10ksubs. 

Actually, my goal is not getting subscribers, my real goal is getting 10k users and 1k subscribers(who signed up for the gold plan, $9.99/month).

And I decided to record my progress in this blog. That's why the name of this blog is "Biz Quest Diary". Like quest diaries in games, I'll give myself some quests and log the results. 


# The Lessons I've Learned to Here. 

It was a long journey of more than 2 years. So, the post is long. I'll end this post with what I've learned. 

1. You can know what you love by checking what you are doing constantly. 
- I blogged about drawing and Japanese, but I stopped them. But I am continuously blogging about Korean for more than 2 years. It means that I truly care about the language. 

2. You should do what you know. 
- The problem with drawing and Japanese was I didn't know too much about them. It's hard to continue when you don't know about your thing. 

3. You should do one at a time. 
- Many business masters advise to start getting subscription earlier. But I did the reverse. I created my system first. It's because I knew that I cannot complete 2 works at a time. Only I can do is to finish one at a time. As I am a developer myself, my lack of app always became a burden to me. So, I started it first. I decided to start from my app to subscribers. 


# Then, what's next?

I'll try my best to share my journey diary from Module 1 with you.
