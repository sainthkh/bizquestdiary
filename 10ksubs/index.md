[10ksubs](http://10ksubs.com/) is created by Bryan Harris of [videofruit.com](http://videofruit.com).

Like its name, the goal of this course is to gather 10,000 subscribers. 

In this post series, I wrote down how I finished every task from the course. You can find:

* how I understood the course and finished the given tasks.
* obstacles I met on the road. 
* small wins and failures.
* etc., etc.

I hope this helps you finish the course.
