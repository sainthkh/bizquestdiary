title: Preparing to Start Module 2.

After finishing Module 1 last week, I had to decide my next move. Following is the log of my thoughts.

# One thing missing. 

At the end of the course, Bryan told us to decide the present I'll give to myself when I finish 100 subs goal. I didn't finish this last week. So, I had to decide. My goal is to buy Japanese books. [As I said earlier in my first post](/10ksubs/journey-to-here), I'm studying Japanese to remind myself how to learn a new language. 

To learn more about Japanese, I decided to [buy more books and study them.](http://www.yes24.com/24/goods/33425413?scode=032&OzSrank=6) In Korea, there is a radio station called EBS(Educational Broadcast System). There are some radio programs that cover intermediate Japanese. I decided to buy 3-month textbooks of the last year they published. 

# Module 2 doesn't fit with my situation.

The first 100 subs goal is to gather eager sneazers. The goal is to gather people infatuated with me. They don't have to be interested in Korean language. 

I met an obstacle from the beginning. As a native Korean, it's kind of nonsense to add Korean friends who cannot speak English to my list because they cannot refer any spending students. 

Then, I had to decide. Should I skip it? 

I decided not. In the course, there are 2 methods for the people like me. To get people from Twitter and forum. So, I decided to get my students from there. 

# Well, I already had 100 subs!

I removed it not long ago, but I added abandoned subscription form for almost 1.5 years. And I've checked how many subscribers I have this week, I had 128!

It's the other reason I thought of skipping module 2. But they are not my members of WiseInit Korean Academy yet. And the original goal was to get 10k members and 1k paying members. So, I should not skip it for now. 

# Then, what should I do next?

After analyzing my current situation, I had to decide a few things. 

First thing I had to decide was this:

>> My goal is to gather 10k members. Then, should I make a separate email list? 

The answer was yes. Even if they aren't member yet, they can be soon. I can send invitation to them. So, I had to add one more goal, 20k subs.

The second thing I have to decide was:

>> Is module 2 cleared? If so, when should I start module 3?

I have more than 100 subs now, but I don't have any members yet. So, it's partially cleared. I decided to mix 2 modules(2 and 3). I decided to go Korean language communities in Facebook, Twitter and others to gather subscribers. 

# Why am I breaking all the rules here?

Some of the most frequently asked questions by the beginners of computer programming is "I did the same. But it doesn't work. Why's that?" 

The answer is "because you didn't do the same." Developers try their best to make every code run same on every platform. But it's their dream. In reality, it's not. You'll meet some odd browsers, OS, syntax, etc. Then, like a video in our first module, we should figure out why it happened. We should learn the difference between the example and my situation. 

I had to do the same with the course.

The context 10ksubs course set was to get from the very beginning. It supposes that you have nothing now. As a matter of fact, I realized that I have too many now. I have a blog of about 8,000~9,000 visitors each month. I have 128 subs, etc. I had to fit the course into my system. 

And the reason behind 100 eager sneazers was because many people lose their interest after a few days. So, you have to finish 100 subs part soon. In my case, I've run the blog more than 2 years. So, losing interest is not the case for me. (Actually, the course mentions share depth first, but I think it is the second reason. Share depth is meaningless if you lose your interest about the topic.)

# What is my next plan?

My conversion rate of the blog was about 0.2~0.3%. It means that I get only 1 subscriber every 2 or 3 days. So, my next goal is to get 1+ subscriber and 1 member a day next week. To do so, I'll do the following.

* Streamline my process for video creation: I decided to make Hangeul, Korean Alphabet course. I'll share this in communities. 
* After sharing it, I'll do my best to gather and contact people.
* Finish redesigning my website, the signup form will be back. 

Getting 200 subs goal and 100 members in 3 weeks(before 2/25) is my first goal.
