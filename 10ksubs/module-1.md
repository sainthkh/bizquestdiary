# What should I do to clear Module 1?

I've watched module 1 again and organized 4 things that I should do to finish the module. 

* To figure out "why".
* Topic
* Product Idea
* First Subscriber

# Why am I doing business?

There is a technique called [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys). It's asking "why"s 5 times to figure out what's the root cause of the problem. 

I've started with 2 major reasons, "to get the financial freedom" and "to earn the money from what I love".

1. Why? - To get the financial freedom.
2. Why? - Not to worry about money.
3. Why? - It's not Biblically correct way of living and it causes too much stress.
4. Why? - To be happy. If you're stressed out, you're not happy with your work. 


1. Why? - To earn money from what I love. 
2. Why? - I want to be happy when I am working.
3. Why? - Hatred shows on the result and I hate it. 
4. Why? - I want to create masterpiece. I want to spend my time for something worthwhile.

Actually, The process ended with 4 whys each. However, I've found the root goal of my mind. 

"Happiness from work" and "desire of creating masterpiece". 

## How do you manage them?

In the course, Bryan recommended to use IFTTT to send email and SMS. 

However, I decided to do it differently. Writing "why"s every morning. Every morning, the words are a bit different from those of yesterday. I personally think it's better than just reading the email/SMS. For the first few days, those messages heat up my mind, but after a few days, they lose their power. 

Frankly speaking, I forgot to do this for a few days lately. So, I did from 5 "why"s again today and I'll continue to write them in the morning. I'll share the result with you next week. 

# Topic

It was decided long ago, Korean language. Until now, I've written about Korean language. However, the specific topic was really random. To learn a new language, you should learn words, grammar, culture, etc. 

So, I decided to create video series of Korean grammar. I've targeted for intermediate to advanced learners for 2 years. But I decided to make a course series that starts from the beginner level to advanced. 

It's the change. 

One thing I learned from 2 years is that every niche is really big. If you are trying to be a marketing blogger, for example, there are so many niches for marketing like email, social media, blog, content, etc. So, it's beneficial to dive deeper into the niche. (Sadly, it's hard to figure out the width and deepness of the niche when you start.)

# Product Idea

1. Subscription
 * Gold Plan: It'll cost $9.99/mon. It's a kind of freemium. You'll get most courses for free. But if you want to use quiz, you should subscribe this.
 * Platinum Plan: It's an idea now. When you are learning a new language, you should practice listening, reading, writing, speaking. As for listening and reading, you can test them by quizzes. However, as for writing and speaking, you can only test them by letting learners write and speak. I'm planning to create system to check their speaking and writing ability. However, I'll do them well later, because I should finish creating courses. The main problem is I don't know how much it'll cost.
2. Bookstore
 * I'm planning to create bookstore with my blog posts. Bundling tips and tricks I taught in the blog and publish them as ebooks.

# First Subscriber

In the course, Bryan shows how to get the first subscriber by sending a message to his mother. 

Unfortunately, my mother doesn't use any IT gadget and she doesn't have email address. So, making her email address and adding her email address is just like adding admin+57132894312@videofruit.com. It's just meaningless. 

And this business is for foreigners. So, it is also not a good idea to add my friends. 

After a few moments, I decided to skip this. But I did one thing. I shared my goal and intent with my mother.
