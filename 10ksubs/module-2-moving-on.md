# The Goals of Last Week

* Streamline my process for video creation: I decided to make Hangeul, Korean Alphabet course. I'll share this in communities. 
* After sharing it, I'll do my best to gather and contact people.
* Finish redesigning my website, the signup form will be back. 

To make matters short, I finished them all. I've streamlined my process to create videos and uploaded them to [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54d-7_t1M8iwlAq7rYIlcQ). 

I shared my posts in Facebook groups. 

I also redesigned my website. 

But there was a problem. 

# What's the problem?

I only got one more subscriber. I put too much energy only on creating contents and I almost ignored promoting them. 

So, that's why the next goal is to find and outreach more people for my membership site. 

* I'll create 5 more videos and share them in my twitter, facebook account. 
* I'll create a landing page for my website.
